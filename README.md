# hello-world
Hi everyone,
This is a fisrt repository that I create in GitHub. So, everyone can see it and laugh out loud.
I am a final student at Ho Chi Minh City University of Science. Now, I am internship at STYL Solution.
I like beatiful girls and always want to kiss hers (haha).
I must study about Free Open Source Software (FOSS) and prepare for a presentation at tomorrow.
Everyone can say "good luck for me @@.
